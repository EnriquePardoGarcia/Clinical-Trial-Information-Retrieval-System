# Clinical-Trial-Information-Retrieval-System
Overview

This project implements a Java-based information retrieval system focused on indexing, searching, and evaluating clinical trial documents.
The system combines traditional retrieval models (such as lexical or keyword-based search) with semantic and embedding-based techniques to improve accuracy in biomedical text search and ranking.

The goal is to provide a framework capable of efficiently handling large collections of clinical trial data while supporting advanced search functionalities and evaluation.

Features

Parsing and Preprocessing of clinical trial data

Indexing using inverted indices for fast document retrieval

Search Engine supporting multiple query types and ranking models

Embedding-based Search for semantic similarity between queries and trials

Batch and Multi-Searcher Modes for large-scale querying

Evaluation of retrieval performance using standard IR metrics

Technologies Used

Language: Java

Core Libraries: Apache Lucene (or similar IR framework)

Example Use Case

The system can be used to:

Search for relevant clinical trials related to a specific disease or treatment.

Evaluate and compare different retrieval models (keyword-based vs. semantic).

Support biomedical text mining or knowledge discovery workflows.
Embedding Models: Pre-trained word or sentence embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, Sentence-BERT)

Evaluation Tools: Custom evaluation classes for precision, recall, and ranking metrics
